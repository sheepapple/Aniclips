AniClips (Temporary Name) is a social media platform designed to help users discover new Anime and Manga through a diverse array of mediums such as: 
  Clips, Threads, Newsboards, Subcommunities, etc…

I started this website project as a way to learn a wide variety of industry standard tools such as:
  React, Firebase, MongoDB, etc...
    ...while also strengthening my skills in front-end development. 

I'm actively working on improving and adding new features! I actively update a journal detailing the full process here:
